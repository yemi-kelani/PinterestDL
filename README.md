# PinterestDL
Very useful for downloading references.
Batch download 25 pins, on 10 boards, saved or created by a specified user.
Simply modify the pinterestUsername and run the script.

This only works on the first 10 boards a user has and only copies up to 25 pins per board.
Beatiful Soup doesn't work well with javascript rendered pages. 
Feel free to fork this repo and modify it to pull in more pins.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Then modify the pinterestUsername and run the script.
